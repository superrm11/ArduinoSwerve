# ArduinoSwerve
A scale model swerve drive powered by Arduino

This will be a module in the 3rd iteration of my 3D printed robots; this time with a *true* swerve drive. The final bot will be controlled via a Raspberry Pi,
however due to a lack of hardware PWM and an ADC, an arduino was chosen to govern the drivetrain. Eventually it will communicate with the Pi via I2C/SPI/Serial, TBD.

Hardware development documentation will be coming soon.
